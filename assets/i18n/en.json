    "faq_head_1": "What is Bitcoin mining?",
    "faq_cont_1": "Bitcoin mining is the process of creating new bitcoin. Thousands of mining rigs compete to solve complex equations that validate Bitcoin transactions and maintain the public ledger, and earn new bitcoin (BTC) for doing so. ",
    "faq_head_2": "What is cloud mining?",
    "faq_cont_2": "Cloud mining is the same process as bitcoin mining but allows individuals to purchase or rent a stake in third party mining operations, to remove the need to set up their own hardware.",
    "faq_head_3": "Why do we need Bitcoin Minetrix?",
    "faq_cont_3": "Bitcoin (BTC) mining is prohibitively expensive for the ordinary person, but anybody can buy and stake BTCMTX tokens to secure a share in the BTC Minetrix cloud mining platform. Traditional cloud mining has unfortunately been soured by scams, but Bitcoin Minetrix removes this risk with a decentralized solution to cloud mining.",
    "faq_head_4": "How is this different to traditional cloud mining?",
    "faq_cont_4": "BTC Minetrix is not like regular cloud mining services in a few important ways. Firstly, by utilizing ERC-20 tokens, we ensure that no money needs to change hands to participate in our cloud mining platform. Secondly, users decide how much bitcoin mining power they want to own by the number of mining credits they earn through BTCMTX token staking. Thirdly, thanks to the smart contract capabilities of the Ethereum blockchain, staking enables us to auto-manage user allocations in the safest and most decentralized way possible for end users.",
    "faq_head_5": "What is the difference between tokens and credits?",
    "faq_cont_5": "BTCMTX is an ERC-20 utility token that needs to be staked in order to earn mining credits. There is a total supply of 4 billion tokens. Mining credits are non-transferable ERC-20 tokens that need to be burned in exchange for cloud mining power. There is no max cap on mining credit tokens.",
